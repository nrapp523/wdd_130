<h3>Nick</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Nick, I was born and raised in Centerville, Utah. I just served my mission in the Utah Layton Mission and just got back a month ago. I love to read, hike, hanging out with friends, playing video games, play sports, and code. I am a computer science major who loves to create things. That is why I am taking this course as it's super helpful tool in any job. I currently work a job as a legal assistant and it is super useful to have because I work in automation and it is super useful to make websites. I love BYUI already and am super excited to see how things go!</p>
