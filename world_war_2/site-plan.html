        <h4>What is this site</h4>
        <p>This site is meant to give an overarching view of World War 2 and what occurred there. It will focus on and will generally inform the reader about the turning points of the War in which the Allies triumphed. In addition there will be another page containing general information about heroic stories of those who served in the Allied forces. </p>
        <h4>Basics of World War 2</h4>
       <p>World War 2 consisted of two basic sides, which included many countries. The Axis Powers, notably including Germany, Italy, and Japan. Also the Allied Powers, notably consisting of Britain, France, Soviet Union, and the United States. The war lasted for roughly 6 years, and officially ended with Japan’s surrender which was finalized, the 2nd of September 1945. It was the worst conflict of all time in terms of death, sitting about anywhere from 50 million to 70 million deaths</p>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Germany invades Czechoslovakia</h4>
<p>This was the first invasion of the war. Initially Allied forces agreed not to interfere, but Germany trespassed on the initial agreement and invaded all of Czechoslovakia instead of the agreed upon region.</p>

<h4>German forces invade Poland</h4>
<p>This was the attack that kickstarted the war. The previous invasion did not incite any additional conflict. Germany invaded at this time when they had an initial treaty with the Soviet Union, that they would split Poland.</p>

<h4>Key players such as Britain and France declare war on Germany</h4>
<p>On September 3, 1939 Britain and France declared war on Germany following the invasion of Poland. Britain and France had a treaty with Poland thus inciting a conflict as soon as Germany invaded Poland.</p>

<h4>Germany invades Denmark and Norway</h4>
<p>On April 9, 1940 Germany attacked Denmark and Norway. After two months German secured both countries and occupied them for extra resources.</p>

<h4>Battle of Dunkirk</h4>
<p>This battle was a defeat of the Allied forces. They had 338,000 Allied soldiers pinned by Germany’s assault against the beaches of Dunkirk, France. The rescue mission was a success saving many lives.</p>

<h4>Italy sides with Axis Powers in war</h4>
<p>In 1936 Italy officially joined together with Germany in the war. This began to officially solidify many of the power dynamics that would be present throughout the war.</p>

<h4>France Surrenders</h4>
<p>On June 22, 1940 the French forces surrendered to Germany after many defeats and setbacks. Germany occupied 60% of the country.</p>

<h4>Battle of Britain</h4>
<p>This was a battle fought in the air. It was the Royal Air Force of Britain, against the German Luftwaffe. This is unique because it set a precedent for battles fought entirely in the air, which had never occurred before.</p>

<h4>Tripartite Pact</h4>
<p>On September 27, 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan officially joined forces. This treaty spelled out specific regions that would go to each country, and that they would defend one another.</p>

<h4>Axis Powers attack Yugoslavia</h4>
<p>On March 25, 1941, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia. Initially Yugoslavia allowed Axis passage through their country, but they reneged on their agreement. This led to the subsequent invasion and occupation where Axis powers occupied Yugoslavia.</p>

<h4>German forces attack Soviet Union</h4>
<p>Germany broke their agreement with the Soviet Union and attacked them. This conflict ended up lasting for an extended period of time. Germany ended up losing, in large part due to the cold weather which Germany was not equipped to handle. This conflict was part of the turning point for the war.</p>

<h4>Pearl Harbor</h4>
<p>On December 7, 1941 Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii. This ultimately ended, causing the US to join forces with the Allied Powers in the war.</p>

<h4>Battle of Midway</h4>
<p>A three day battle in the middle of 1942. This was a conflict between the Japanese and US, and the US ended up triumphing.</p>

<h4>Battle of Stalingrad</h4>
<p>From 1942-1943 this conflict was Germany vs Soviet Union, where the Germans attempted to take the city of Stalingrad from Russia. Russia ultimately surrounded them, and led to a large-scale surrender by a portion of the German army.</p>

<h4>Italy Surrenders</h4>
<p>On September 8, 1943 Italy surrendered to the Allies after serious losses.</p>

<h4>D-Day</h4>
<p>On June 6, 1944 the Allied forces launched a large-scale invasion on the Axis Powers. They landed on the beaches of Normandy and France. Many consider this the turning point of the war.</p>

<h4>Battle of the Bulge</h4>
<p>An offensive counter by the German forces on the Allied forces. Germany ended up losing this battle with significant casualties.</p>

<h4>Germany Surrenders</h4>
<p>On May 7, 1945 Germany surrenders.</p>

      <h3>D-Day: The Turning Point</h3>
      <p>
       This page will include lots of information about D-Day and how it was the turning point for the conflict. I will do more research to hammer down more about it.
